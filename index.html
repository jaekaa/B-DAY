          <p><strong>Happy Birthday, my Baby.</strong></p>

          <p>Today is your special day, but to me, every day feels special because I get to spend it with you. I just
            want to take this moment to tell you how deeply grateful I am for you — for your patience, for your
            kindness, for your love.</p>

          <p>Thank you for being the person who listens to me even when I struggle to find the right words, and who
            stays even when I feel unlovable. You make me feel seen, understood, and safe in a way I never thought
            possible. I hope you know how much your presence means to me — how much you mean to me.</p>

          <p>Minsan hindi ko nasasabi nang buo, pero sobra kitang na-aappreciate. Yung simpleng pangungumusta mo, yung
            mga lambing mo, yung mga times na you choose to stay and try… those little things, they stay with me. You
            make my heart softer, calmer, and happier.</p>

          <p>I love you not just for the good moments, but for the days when things get difficult and we still choose
            each other. I love you for your dreams, your softness, your strength, and even the things you're still
            learning about yourself. I love you on the days you shine, and even more on the days you don't feel like you
            do.</p>

          <p>On your birthday, I want you to feel the warmth, care, and love you always give to those around you. You
            deserve so much joy, peace, and fulfillment. I pray that life becomes kinder to you, that your dreams come
            closer, and that you continue to grow into the amazing person you already are.</p>

          <p>And as you move forward, I want you to remember this: <strong>I'm here. I'm with you. I'm choosing
              you</strong> — today, tomorrow, and for every version of the future we'll build together.</p>

          <p><strong>Happy Birthday Marc ko💗</strong><br>
            Thank you for being you.<br>
            Thank you for being mine.</p>

          <p><strong>I love you!! Mwah</strong></p>
